# hbd-alert-bot
A telegram bot that alerts you whose birthday is coming. The bot is here [hbd_alert_bot](http://t.me/hbd_alert_bot), ~~deployed on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/)~~, now I deployed it on my own RaspberryPi.



## Feature

* Telegram bot using [telegraf](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf), written in TypeScript.
* Database support using MySQL with [Typeorm](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm)
* Alert periodically, using [node-cron](https://github.com/node-cron/node-cron), based on GNU crontab.
* Date calculation using [day.js](https://day.js.org/).
* Configurable. Set the timezone, alert schedule, mysql configuration and debug proxy freely.
* Tell you whose birthday is already today, or in 3 days, or will be in this week.

1. Clone the repo

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/Thungghuan/hbd-alert-bot.git

## TODO

* Add validation when add birthday data.
* Make the alert message more detailed, maybe some words like **tomorrow**, **Next Monday** etc.
* Make birthday alert more configurable.
* Make a tool to format the output message.



## Why the bot?

Have you ever forget someone's birthday? This bot is created to alert you so you won't realize someone's birthday was just pasted, and regretfully tell him or her happy birthday for next year in advanceðŸ¤ª.

I have got a duty to send a hbd message in a wechat group these days, but I usually forget it, so I make this bot, and I wish this bot would help me remember it. Actually making a bot is so fun:)

Wish you have fun making your own bot too.
